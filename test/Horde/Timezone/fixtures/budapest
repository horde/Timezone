# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-07-13):
#
# I found what is probably a typo of 2:00 which should perhaps be 2:00s
# in the C-Eur rule from tz database version 2008d (this part was
# corrected in version 2008d). The circumstantial evidence is simply the
# tz database itself, as seen below:
#

# Rule Belgium 1945 only - Sep 16  2:00s 0 -
# Rule Neth 1945 only - Sep 16 2:00s 0 -
#
# The rule line to be changed is:
#
# Rule C-Eur 1945 only - Sep 16  2:00 0 -
#
# It seems that Paris, Monaco, Rule France, Rule Belgium all agree on
# 2:00 standard time, e.g. 3:00 local time.  However there are no
# countries that use C-Eur rules in September 1945, so the only items
# affected are apparently these fictitious zones that translate acronyms
# CET and MET:
#
# Zone CET  1:00 C-Eur CE%sT
# Zone MET  1:00 C-Eur ME%sT
#
# It this is right then the corrected version would look like:
#
# Rule C-Eur 1945 only - Sep 16  2:00s 0 -
#
# A small step for mankind though 8-)
